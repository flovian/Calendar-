# Front end `Html`, `Css`, `Javascrpt`

In this project, I learned how to incoporate `JS`, `html`, and `css`
in a project.I developed a working calendar.

## Project scope :page_with_curl:

* **HTML**
  * [index.html](./index.html): Contains class and attributes.

* **CSS**
  * [style.css](./1-style.css): Custom css for the designing aesthetic feel of the project.

* **JS**
  * [script.js](./script.js): Contain scripts for the entire project.
